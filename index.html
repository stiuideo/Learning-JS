    <p>
      This is a list of things this programmer is probably thinking:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>He knows javascript</li>
      <li>He have a large and hot cup of coffee</li>
      <li>All his bills are paid</li>
      <li>He is in a public website</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Right now, he will do, in that specific order:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Put a good song on spotify</li>
      <li>Gently close his eyes</li>
      <li>Slowly drink his coffe</li>
      <li>Open his eyes with determination</li>
      <li>Start vibe coding</li>
    </ol>
