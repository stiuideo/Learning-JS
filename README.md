# Learning JS
 A simple project saying how much I love JS while using way more html and css to do stuff.

Principles of doing this project:
-Look at documentations first. 
-Don't use IA autocomplete.
-Type things, like an Aztec.

Main goals:
-Really learn programming
-Focus on js, html and css first
-Learn and increment steps of development cycle when needed

Most used documentations for now:
